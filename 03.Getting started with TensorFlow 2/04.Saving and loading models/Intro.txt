There are actually a few ways of saving and loading models TensorFllow such as only saving the parameters or the weights of a model 
or saving the entire model including the architecture. You can also save the architecture only without the weights.

As well as that you'll see how you can include model saving as part of the training run which of course is really useful 
in case the training gets interrupted for some reason and you want to restart it 
but you can also do some more sophisticated things like saving a model depending on certain performance measures.

As you might expect from what you saw previously 
we can use callbacks to do this for us and there's a built-in call back TensorFlow just for this purpose.

Finally as well as saving and loading your own models, you'll see that there are many pre-trained TensorFlow models 
that can be downloaded and used in your applications.
