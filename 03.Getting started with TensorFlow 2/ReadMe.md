# Getting started with TensorFlow 2
Complete end-to-end workflow for developing deep learning models with Tensorflow, from building, training, evaluating and predicting with models using the Sequential API, validating models and including regularisation, implementing callbacks, and saving and loading models. 

Tensorflow is an open source machine library, and is one of the most widely used frameworks for deep learning. The release of Tensorflow 2 marks a step change in the product development, with a central focus on ease of use for all users, from beginner to advanced level.

## [01.Introduction to TensorFlow](https://github.com/udaypratapyati/DeepLearning_With_Tensorflow2/tree/master/03.Getting%20started%20with%20TensorFlow%202/01.Introduction%20to%20TensorFlow/notebooks)
TensorFlow is one of the most popular libraries for deep learning, and itâ€™s widely used today amongst researchers and professionals at all levels. 
- Get started with using TensorFlow. 
- Some helpful resources when developing deep learning models in TensorFlow, including Google Colab. 
- Getting everything set up, ready for diving into TensorFlow.

## [02.The Sequential model API](https://github.com/udaypratapyati/DeepLearning_With_Tensorflow2/tree/master/03.Getting%20started%20with%20TensorFlow%202/02.The%20Sequential%20model%20API)
There are multiple ways to build and apply deep learning models in TensorFlow, from high-level, quick and easy-to-use APIs, to low-level operations. 
- Use high-level Keras API for quickly building, training, evaluating and predicting from deep learning models. 
- Practice and develop an image classification model from scratch on the MNIST dataset of handwritten images.

## [03.Validation, regularisation and callbacks](https://github.com/udaypratapyati/DeepLearning_With_Tensorflow2/tree/master/03.Getting%20started%20with%20TensorFlow%202/03.Validation%20Regularisation%20And%20Callbacks)
Model validation and selection is an essential part of developing any machine learning model development to help prevent overfitting and improve generalisation. 
- Use a validation dataset in a training run and apply regularisation techniques to model.
- Use callbacks to monitor performance and perform actions according to specified criteria. 
- Put model validation and regularisation into practice on the well-known Iris dataset.

## [04.Saving and loading models](https://github.com/udaypratapyati/DeepLearning_With_Tensorflow2/tree/master/03.Getting%20started%20with%20TensorFlow%202/04.Saving%20and%20loading%20models)
As part of deep learning model development, we need to be able to save and load TensorFlow models, possibly according to certain criteria you want to specify.
- Use callbacks to save models, manual saving and loading, and options that are available when saving models, including saving weights only. 
- Practice loading and using pre-trained deep learning models. 
- Write flexible model saving and loading implementations for a model trained on satellite images.

## [05.Capstone Project](https://github.com/udaypratapyati/DeepLearning_With_Tensorflow2/tree/master/03.Getting%20started%20with%20TensorFlow%202/05.Capstone%20Project)
Learnt an end-to-end workflow for developing deep learning models in Tensorflow. 
- Develop a deep learning classifier on a labelled image dataset of street view house numbers.
