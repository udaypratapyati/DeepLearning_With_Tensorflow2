## Convolutional Neural Networks
- Implement the foundational layers of CNNs (pooling, convolutions) and stack them properly in a deep network to solve multi-class image classification problems.
- Practical tricks and methods used in deep CNNs straight from the research papers.
- Apply knowledge of CNNs to one of the toughest but hottest field of computer vision: Object detection.
- How CNNs can be applied to multiple fields, including art generation and face recognition. Implement algorithm to generate art and recognize faces!
