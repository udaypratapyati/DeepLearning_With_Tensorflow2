# Customizing your models with Tensorflow 2
TensorFlow is an open source machine library, and is one of the most widely used frameworks for deep learning. 
The release of TensorFlow 2 marks a step change in the product development, with a central focus on ease of use for all users, from beginner to advanced level. 

## The Keras functional API
TensorFlow offers multiple levels of API for constructing deep learning models, with varying levels of control and flexibility.
- Use the functional API for developing more flexible model architectures, including models with multiple inputs and outputs. 
- Learn about Tensors and Variables, as well as accessing and using inner layers within a model. 
- Transfer learning application on the dogs and cats image dataset.

## Data Pipeline
A flexible and efficient data pipeline is one of the most essential parts of deep learning model development. 
- Powerful workflow for loading, processing, filtering and even augmenting data on the fly using tools from Keras and the tf.data module. 
- Apply tools to implement a data pipeline for the LSUN and CIFAR-100 datasets.

## Sequence Modelling
Sequence modelling tasks represent a rich and interesting class of problems, ranging from natural language tasks such as part-of-speech tagging and sentiment analysis, to forecasting of financial time series and speech audio generation. 
- Use the recurrent neural network API in TensorFlow, as well as several useful layer types and tools for processing sequence data. 
- Develop a generative language model on the Shakespeare dataset.

## Model subclassing and custom training loops
For more advanced use cases of TensorFlow, it is possible to obtain a low level of control over the design and behaviour of your deep learning model, as well as the training loop itself. 
- How to exploit the Model and Layer subclassing API to develop fully flexible model architectures.
- Use the automatic differentiation tools in TensorFlow to implement custom training loops. 
- Implement these custom model building tools to develop a deep residual network.

## Capstone Project
- Develop a custom neural translation model from English into German.
