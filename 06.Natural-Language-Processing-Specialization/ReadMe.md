# Natural Language Processing Specialization
Natural Language Processing (NLP) uses algorithms to understand and manipulate human language. 
This technology is one of the most broadly applied areas of machine learning. 
As AI continues to expand, so will the demand for professionals skilled at building models that analyze speech and language, uncover contextual patterns, and produce insights from text and audio.

- Design NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis.
- Create tools to translate languages and summarize text, and even build chatbots. 

#### NLP applications are going to be at the forefront of the coming transformation to an AI-powered future.

### [01. Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces](https://github.com/udaypratapyati/DeepLearning_With_Tensorflow2/tree/master/06.Natural-Language-Processing-Specialization/01.Natural%20Language%20Processing%20with%20Classification%20and%20Vector%20Spaces)
- Perform sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression and then na√Øve Bayes, 
- Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships, 
- Write a simple English to French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbor search.

### [02. Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models]()
- Create a simple auto-correct algorithm using minimum edit distance and dynamic programming,
- Apply the Viterbi Algorithm for part-of-speech (POS) tagging, which is important for computational linguistics,
- Write a better auto-complete algorithm using an N-gram language model, and 
- Write your own Word2Vec model that uses a neural network to compute word embeddings using a continuous bag-of-words model.
