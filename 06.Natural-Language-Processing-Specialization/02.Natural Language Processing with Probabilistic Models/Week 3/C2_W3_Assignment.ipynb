numerator is the same sequence followed by the word $w_t$.\n","\n","Later, you will modify the equation (2) by adding k-smoothing, which avoids errors when any counts are zero.\n","\n","The equation

for an arbitrary number $n$.\n","\n","When computing the counts for n-grams, prepare the sentence beforehand by prepending $n-1$ starting markers \"<s\\>\" to indicate the beginning of the sentence.  \n","- For example, in the bi-gram model (N=2), a sequence with two start tokens \"<s\\><s\\>\" should predict the first word of a sentence.\n","- So, if the sentence is \"I like food\", modify it to be \"<s\\><s\\> I like food\".\n","- Also prepare the sentence for counting by appending an end token \"<e\\>\" so that the model can predict when to finish a sentence.\n","\n","Technical note: In this implementation, you will store the counts as a dictionary.\n","- The key of each key-value pair in the dictionary is a **tuple** of n words (and not a list)\n","- The value in the key-value pair
