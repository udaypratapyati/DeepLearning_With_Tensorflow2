## Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models
- Create a simple auto-correct algorithm using minimum edit distance and dynamic programming,
- Apply the Viterbi Algorithm for part-of-speech (POS) tagging, which is important for computational linguistics.
- Write a better auto-complete algorithm using an N-gram language model.
- Write your own Word2Vec model that uses a neural network to compute word embeddings using a continuous bag-of-words model.
