You might be wondering, though, whether you need to pass in your input text 3 times, since for causal attention, the queries Q, keys K, and values V all come from the same source. Fortunately, `tl.CausalAttention()` handles this as well by making use of the [`tl.Branch()`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#module-trax.layers.combinators) combinator layer. In general, each branch within a `tl.Branch()` layer performs parallel operations on copies of the layer's inputs. For causal attention, each branch (representing Q, K, and V) applies a linear transformation (i.e. a dense layer without a subsequent activation) to its copy of the input, then splits that result into heads. You can see the syntax for this in the screenshot from the `trax.layers.attention.py` [source code](https://github.com/google/trax/blob/master/trax/layers/attention.py) below: \n","\n","<img src=\"transformer_decoder_lnb_figs/use-of-tl-Branch-in-tl-CausalAttention.png\" width=\"500\"/>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"l9Ar2jTQokLU"},"source":["## Feed-forward layer \n","* Typically ends with a ReLU activation, but we'll leave open the possibility of a different activation\n","* Most of the parameters are here"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ex0me0mXokLV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1602604666747,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1083,"user":{"displayName":"Uday Pratap Yati","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gj471mFfPb74fTJaY831rOrH32GTTiGtD-sz0gmNw=s64","userId":"07167909339760484251"}}},"source":["def FeedForward(d_model, d_ff, dropout, mode, ff_activation):\n","    \"\"\"Returns a list of layers that implements a feed-forward block.\n","\n","    The input is an activation tensor.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        d_model (int):  depth of embedding.\n","        d_ff (int): depth of feed-forward layer.\n","        dropout (float): dropout rate (how much to drop out).\n","        mode (str): 'train' or 'eval'.\n","        ff_activation (function): the non-linearity in feed-forward layer.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        list: list of trax.layers.combinators.Serial that maps an activation tensor to an activation tensor.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    \n","    # Create feed-forward block (list) with two dense layers with dropout and input normalized\n","    return [ \n","        # Normalize layer inputs\n","        tl.LayerNorm(), \n","        # Add first feed forward (dense) layer (don't forget to set the correct value for n_units)\n","        tl.Dense(d_ff), \n","        # Add activation function passed in as a parameter (you need to call it!)\n","        ff_activation(),  # Generally ReLU\n","        # Add dropout with rate and mode specified (i.e., don't use dropout during evaluation)\n","        tl.Dropout(rate=dropout, mode=mode), \n","        # Add second feed forward layer (don't forget to set the correct value for n_units)\n","        tl.Dense(d_model), \n","        # Add dropout with rate and mode specified (i.e., don't use dropout during evaluation)\n","        tl.Dropout(rate=dropout, mode=mode) \n","    ]"],"execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zQQutixjokLZ"},"source":["## Decoder block\n","Here, we return a list containing two residual blocks.
