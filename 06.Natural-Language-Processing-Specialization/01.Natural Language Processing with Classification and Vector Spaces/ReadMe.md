## Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces
- Perform sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression and then na√Øve Bayes, 
- Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships 
- Write a simple English to French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbor search.
