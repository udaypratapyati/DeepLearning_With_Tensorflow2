# Sequences, Time Series and Prediction
- How to build time series models in TensorFlow. 
- Implement best practices to prepare time series data. 
- Explore how RNNs and 1D ConvNets can be used for prediction. 
- Build a sunspot prediction model using real-world data!

## 01.Sequences and Prediction
- Unique considerations involved when handling sequential time series data 
	- where values change over time, like the temperature on a particular day, or the number of visitors to your web site.
- Various methodologies for predicting future values in these time series.

## 02.Deep Neural Networks for Time Series
- Teach neural networks to recognize and predict on time series!

## 03.Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series
- Recurrent Neural networks and Long Short Term Memory networks are really useful to classify and predict on sequential data. 

## 04.Real-world time series data
- On top of DNNs and RNNs, add convolutions, and then put it all together using a real-world data series 
	- One which measures sunspot activity over hundreds of years, and see if we can predict using it.
